    <h1>Self-Driving Cars, Explained</h1>
    <h2>A messaging guide for talking about our autonomous car future</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Ask your mother-in-law over coffee. Bring it up over wine with friends. Talk to a bunch of kids when it’s your turn to carpool. Call your dad.</p>
        <p>“When do you think we’ll have self-driving cars? Will *you* ride in them?!”</p>
        <p>For all the rapid progress we’re making toward a self-driving future, the answers you get are probably, “A long time from now,” and somewhere between “maybe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯?” and “when they pry the steering wheel from my hands.”</p>
        <p>Thing is, they are coming—fast. But we’re lousy at explaining what that will mean for people’s lives. We’re too technical, too in awe of the technology, too pie-in-the-sky, too quick to assume that culture will shift without a fight.</p>
        <p>And that’s a problem, because we have big decisions to make right now—about insurance, regulation, taxes, labor, our cities—that will determine whether we get it right or muck it all up.</p>
        <p>So, I’ve assembled a messaging guide to explain self-driving cars, why they matter, and how we can use this big transformative moment to improve the places we live and make people’s lives better. It builds on the amazing work of Robin Chase and many others, and it’s just a first draft.</p>
        <p>So with that, start your engines! Err.. unlock your phone? Onward!</p>
